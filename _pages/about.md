Welcome! I am Siddharth Shrivastava. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the AI Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. I completed my BTech (2020 batch) in electronics and telecommunications from NIT Raipur. I am currently working on the Mathematical aspects of Machine Learning.  

The purpose of my existence is to live in Mathematics. I believe in "The Monotony and Solitude of a quite life stimulates the creative mind".
