Welcome! I am Siddharth Shrivastava. I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the AI Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. I am fortunate to be working under the guidance of [Prof. Ganesh Ghalme](https://sites.google.com/view/ganeshghalme/home)  and [Prof. P.K. Srijith](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home). My research area lies in the span of Responsible Artificial Intelligence domain.

I believe "The monotony and solitude of a quite life stimulates the creative mind". One of the shlok (from Geeta: chapter 2, verse 38) that I like the most is "sukha-duḥkhe same kṛitvā lābhālābhau jayājayau tato yuddhāya yujyasva naivaṁ pāpam avāpsyasi," It means: "Fight for the sake of duty, treating alike happiness and distress, loss and gain, victory and defeat. Fulfilling your responsibility in this way, you will never incur sin."
