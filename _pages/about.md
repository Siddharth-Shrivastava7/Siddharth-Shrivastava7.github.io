I am Siddharth Shrivastava, a 2<sup>nd</sup>-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. I am pursuing my doctoral research under the supervision of [Dr. Ganesh Ghalme](https://sites.google.com/view/ganeshghalme/home) and [Dr. P.K. Srijith](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home). My research interests lie in the areas of Responsible AI, Strategic Learning, and Generative Modeling. Before joining IIT Hyderabad, I worked on diffusion-based generative models for enhancing urban driving segmentation at IIT Delhi and on medical image analysis at IIT Bombay. I believe that “Let there be light” are simple yet profound words, symbolizing the importance of smile and joy in life.
