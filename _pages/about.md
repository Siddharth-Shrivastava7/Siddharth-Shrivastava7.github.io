Welcome! I am Siddharth Shrivastava. I am a second-year year Ph.D. student in the AI Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. I am fortunate to be working under the guidance of [Prof. Ganesh Ghalme](https://sites.google.com/view/ganeshghalme/home)  and [Prof. P.K. Srijith](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home). My research focuses on Strategic Learning, Responsible AI, and Generative Modeling. Previously, I worked on diffusion-based generative models to improve urban-driving segmentation at IIT Delhi and explored medical image analysis at IIT Bombay. I believe "Let there be Light, Smile and Joy are simply woow in life".
