Welocome! I am Siddharth Shrivastava. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the AI Department at Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. I completed my BTech (2020 batch) in electronics and telecommunications from NIT Raipur. I am interested in machine learning and believe it has many potential societal advantages. I am more inclined toward the Mathematical aspects of Machine Learning. 

My principle is "Being In Flow State For My Purpose". To gain anything truly, we must first lose everything; on the same line, Deep, Prolonged Concentration is an essential skill for excellence. The purpose of my existence is to devote my life to the field of Mathematics and Machine Learning. One of the shlok (from Geeta: chapter 2, verse 38) that I like the most is "sukha-duḥkhe same kṛitvā lābhālābhau jayājayau tato yuddhāya yujyasva naivaṁ pāpam avāpsyasi," It means: "Fight for the sake of duty, treating alike happiness and distress, loss and gain, victory and defeat. Fulfilling your responsibility in this way, you will never incur sin."
