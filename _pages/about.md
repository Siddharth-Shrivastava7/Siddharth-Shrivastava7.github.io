Welcome! I am Siddharth Shrivastava. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the AI Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. I completed my BTech (2020 batch) in electronics and telecommunications from NIT Raipur. I am currently working on the Mathematical aspects of Machine Learning.  

The purpose of my existence is to live in Mathematics. I believe in "The monotony and solitude of a quite life stimulates the creative mind". One of the shlok (from Geeta: chapter 2, verse 38) that I like the most is "sukha-duḥkhe same kṛitvā lābhālābhau jayājayau tato yuddhāya yujyasva naivaṁ pāpam avāpsyasi," It means: "Fight for the sake of duty, treating alike happiness and distress, loss and gain, victory and defeat. Fulfilling your responsibility in this way, you will never incur sin."
