Welocome! I am Siddharth Shrivastava. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the AI Department at Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. I completed my BTech (2020 batch) in electronics and telecommunications from NIT Raipur. I am immensely interested in machine learning and believe it has many potential societal advantages. I am more inclined toward the Mathematical aspects of Machine Learning, and specifically, I am deep-diving into the Generative Modelling field. 

My principle is "One person can give HOPE." By this, I mean conveying that anyone from anywhere can do anything! If they are ready to sacrifice everything else, My sole purpose for my existence is to devote my life to the field of Mathematics and Machine Learning. One of the shlok (from Geeta: chapter 2, verse 38) that I like the most is "sukha-duḥkhe same kṛitvā lābhālābhau jayājayau tato yuddhāya yujyasva naivaṁ pāpam avāpsyasi," It means: "Fight for the sake of duty, treating alike happiness and distress, loss and gain, victory and defeat. Fulfilling your responsibility in this way, you will never incur sin."
