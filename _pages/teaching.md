## Notes 
These notes I made to help myself organize the content I would teach every three alternate weeks are linked below. I am the only author of these notes; therefore, they could not be entirely accurate. Hence, there's no assurance that the notes are error-free. However, I make every effort to ensure that there are no errors in the notes. If you discover any errors, whether logical, conceptual, or otherwise, please email me. I will review the feedback and make necessary corrections, updating the notes accordingly.
